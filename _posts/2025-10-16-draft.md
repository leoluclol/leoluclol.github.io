Picture this:
Someone or a Small group of people has an objective and hence some work to do. As soon as the task become more complex that a 3-hour-job, some kind of tracking tool helps with organization on the personal or group level, because it avoids having to keep stuff in you rhead that you don't really need for the next 1-hour task.

Trying to give somthing a structure is hard. And i mean really hard. Not so much because 

Bell labd worked. And their recipe was simple: Hire great and ambitious people

The possibility of imporvement for a task lies in the difference between the perfectly structured way of performing the task that's written on paper and the probably less efficient but original way that someone might perform a task if given lavish directions.

Keep this delta too high and you end up with a mess where noone knows what they are doing and why, keep it too low and you end up with perfectly predictable results, but that have no possibility to improve.
Keep the delta at just the right amount and you end up allowing space for creativity and performance improvement.
